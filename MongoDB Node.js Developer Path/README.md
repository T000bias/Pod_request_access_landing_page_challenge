## Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas
- On MongoDB Atlas, your data is saved on a replica set
  - This is a group of servers that hold your data.
  - Ensures data redundancy and high availability
- In Atlas there are 2 types of servers, serverless and clusters
  - Serverless instances scales on demand and only charge you what you use.
- A cluster is several MongoDB servers working together.
  - Option 1 - Shared:
    - Smaller clusters
  - Option 2 - Dedicated: 
    - Larger dedicated resources that can be customized; perfered for production workloads.
- Atlas also includes **operational insights** and **backups with point-in-time restore**.
  - You can also manage projects from the command line and **administation API**.
